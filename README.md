# ADOPET
## There’s a new kind of people we see now-a-days. The ones who will want a pet, haggle for the cheapest one and eventually abandon their old and sick dogs – pushing them out of moving cars or dumping them outside animal shelters. Next, there are those who, if they see a puppy on the street, will get it home... 
##By this project entitled ADOPET, I want to connect those two kinds of people together. So that both of them will be satisfied. My project not only presents the key improvement of the pet care system, but also meets the needs of owners who are out for works. 
##There are 3 types of users in this sytem - Administrator, Customers and Care takers. 
##The customer can register, update details of pets, adopt and get services for their pets like grooming, training, booking vaccination, etc. 
##The care taker has the responsibility to screening people who wants their services provided by ADOPET. They can view booking details, manage homecare services and vaccine bookings & edit vaccination details, 
##The admin has the duty to control overall management such as keeping records, managing care taker, view pet gallery, view booking details and update veterinarian’s details.
